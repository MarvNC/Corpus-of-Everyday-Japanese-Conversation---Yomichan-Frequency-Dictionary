## Summary from website:
>The Corpus of Everyday Japanese Conversation (CEJC) is a vocabulary and word count table based on 200 hours of recorded data (approximately from April 2016 to 2020).

>Our project will develop a large-scale corpus of Japanese everyday conversation in a balanced manner. Since informants record their conversations in everyday situations by themselves, naturally occurring conversations can be collected. To build an empirical foundation for the corpus design, we conducted a survey of ordinary conversational behavior of about 250 adults."

>Since there were several ranks included in the file, the overall rank was chosen to generate this frequency dictionary.
